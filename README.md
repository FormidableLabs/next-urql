## `next-urql`

A set of convenience utilities for using `urql` with NextJS.

### Motivation

Using GraphQL with server-side rendering in React is a challenging problem. Currently, React has no support for `Suspense` for data fetching on the server. To get around this, a prepass step can be used to walk the tree (or a subsection of the tree) of your React application and suspend when it encounters thrown `Promise`s. For more information, check out [`react-ssr-prepass`](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/react-ssr-prepass).

`next-urql` handles integrating this prepass step for you, such that your NextJS application using `urql` will prefetch your GraphQL queries on the server before sending down markup to the client.

### Installation

Install `next-urql` along with its `peerDependencies`.

```sh
npm install --save next-urql react-is styled-components isomorphic-unfetch
```

`react-is`, `styled-components`, and `isomorphic-unfetch` help to support server-side `Suspense` with `react-ssr-prepass`. This assumes you have followed the basic installation steps for `urql` [here](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/urql#installation).

### Usage

To use `next-urql`, first `import` the `withUrqlClient` higher order component.

```javascript
import { withUrqlClient } from 'next-urql';
```

Then, for any page in your `pages` directory for which you want to prefetch GraphQL queries, wrap the page in `withUrqlClient`. For example, let's say you have an `index.js` page that renders two components that make GraphQL requests using `urql`, `PokemonList` and `PokemonTypes`. To run their queries initially on the server-side you'd do something like the following:

```javascript
import React from 'react';
import Head from 'next/head';
import { withUrqlClient } from 'next-urql';

import PokemonList from '../components/pokemon_list';
import PokemonTypes from '../components/pokemon_types';

const Root = () => (
  <div>
    <Head>
      <title>Root</title>
      <link rel="icon" href="/static/favicon.ico" />
    </Head>

    <PokemonList />
    <PokemonTypes />
  </div>
);

export default withUrqlClient({ url: 'https://graphql-pokemon.now.sh' })(Root);
```

Read more below in the [API](#API) section to learn more about the arguments that can be passed to `withUrqlClient`.

#### Integration with `_app.js`

Next allows you to override the root of your application using a special page called [`_app.js`](https://nextjs.org/docs#custom-app). If you want to have all GraphQL requests in your application fetched on the server-side, you _could_ wrap the component exported by `_app.js` in `withUrqlClient`. However, be aware that this will opt you out of [automatic static optimization](https://nextjs.org/docs#automatic-static-optimization) for your entire application. In general, it's recommended practice to only use `withUrqlClient` on the pages that have GraphQL operations in their component tree. Read more in the [Caveats](#Caveats) section.

### API

`next-urql` exposes a single higher order component, `withUrqlClient`. This HoC accepts two arguments:

#### `clientOptions` (Required)

The `clientOptions` argument is required. It represents all of the options you want to enable on your `urql` Client instance. It has the following type:

```typescript
export interface ClientOptions {
  /** The GraphQL endpoint your application is using. */
  url: string;
  /** Any additional options to pass to fetch. */
  fetchOptions?: RequestInit | (() => RequestInit);
  /** An alternative fetch implementation. */
  fetch?: typeof fetch;
  /** The default request policy for requests. */
  requestPolicy?: RequestPolicy;
}
```

In client-side SPAs using `urql`, you typically configure the `Client` yourself and pass it as the `value` prop to `urql`'s context `Provider`. `withUrqlClient` handles setting all of this up for you under the hood. By default, you'll be opted into server-side `Suspense` and have the necessary `exchanges` setup for you, including the [`ssrExchange`](https://formidable.com/open-source/urql/docs/api/#ssrexchange-exchange-factory). If you need to customize your exchanges beyond the defaults `next-urql` provides, use the second argument to `withUrqlClient`, `mergeExchanges`.

#### `mergeExchanges` (Optional)

The `mergeExchanges` argument is optional. This is a function that takes the `ssrExchange` created by `next-urql` as its only argument and allows you to configure your exchanges as you wish. It has the following type signature:

```typescript
(ssrExchange: SSRExchange) => Exchange[]
```

By default, `next-urql` will incorprate the `ssrExchange` into your `exchanges` array in the correct location (after any other caching exchanges, but _before_ the `fetchExchange` – read more [here](https://formidable.com/open-source/urql/docs/basics/#setting-up-the-client)). Use this argument if you want to configure your client with additional custom `exchanges`, or access the `ssrCache` directly to extract or restore data from its cache.

### Example

You can see an example project with `next-urql` in our [example directory](/example/README.md) or on [CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/next-urql-pokedex-oqj3x).

### Caveats

`withUrqlClient` implements NextJS's unique `getInitialProps` method uner the hood. This means that any page containing a component wrapped by `withUrqlClient` will be opted out of [automatic static optimization](https://nextjs.org/docs#automatic-static-optimization). Automatic static optimization was added in Next v9, so you shouldn't worry about this if using an earlier version of Next. This is **not** unique to `next-urql` – any implementation of `getInitialProps` by any component in your application will cause Next to opt out of automatic static optimization.
